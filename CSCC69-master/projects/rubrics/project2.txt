    - Robustness of system calls: 25 points
    - Functionality of features that VM might break: 25 points
    - Functionality of base file system: 30 points
        
Documentation*:
    - Argument Passing: 12 points
    - System Calls: 33 points

Overall quality and organization: 20 points
    - The documentation:
        - does follow the required structure and formatting overall
        - has answers that are clean, consistent, well organized and indented properly
        - does not have excessive capitalization, punctuation, spelling, or grammar errors
    - The repository:
        - does follow the required structure
        - does not contained superfluous files (automatically generated files, discarded files and so on)
    - The coding style: 
        - follows the coding style describe in the documentation
        - is clean, consistent, well organized and indented properly
        - does not repeat itself (DRY principle) and is easily maintainable
        - uses informative variable and function identifiers
        - has appropriate comments on structure, structure members, global or static variables, or function definitions
        - does not contain any unused commented code
        - does not compile with warnings
        - does not generate superfluous debugging messages while running
    - The code comments:
        - helps understand the intent of your code (a.k.a why more than how)
        - does not paraphrase the code
        
* Each question is worth 3 points. Points will be deducted as follows:
    -3 for completely wrong answer (or an answer that does not match the code submitted)
    -2 for a vague answer
    -1 for an incomplete but yet seemingly correct answer
