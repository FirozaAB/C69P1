1. What does `mmap` do?

2. When should you read file content into the memory?

3. When should you write data back to the file system?

4. What happens if two processes mmap the same file?

5. What happens when you delete a file while it is mmapped?

6. (This is unrelated to memory mapped file specifically). What happen if a page is currently read or written (by the DMA - Direct Memory Access) and that page gets evicted?
